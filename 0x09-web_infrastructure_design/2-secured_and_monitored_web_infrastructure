Load Balancer with SSL Termination:

Why it's added: Load balancers distribute traffic across multiple servers for improved availability and performance. SSL termination here offloads SSL/TLS encryption and decryption from the application servers, reducing their processing load.
Issue: SSL termination at the load balancer can be problematic because it can expose unencrypted traffic within the internal network. Extra measures are needed to secure the internal communication.
Three Servers (Server 1, 2, 3):

Why they are added: These are application servers that host the website. Having multiple servers ensures redundancy and load distribution.
Issue: If all servers are identical and one fails or has a vulnerability, it affects all servers simultaneously.
Firewalls (Firewall 1, 2, 3):

Why they are added: Firewalls provide security by filtering network traffic, allowing only authorized traffic to reach the servers.
No issue here.
Monitoring Clients (Client 1, 2, 3):

Why they are added: Monitoring tools help in tracking the health and performance of the infrastructure, detect issues, and ensure high availability.
How they collect data: These clients collect data by sending requests and receiving responses from various components (e.g., web servers, databases) and feeding that data into a monitoring service like Sumo Logic.
SSL Certificate:

Why it's added: To serve www.foobar.com over HTTPS, providing data encryption, authenticity, and integrity.
No issue here.
MySQL Server (Database):

Why it's added: To store and manage the website's data.
Issue: Having only one MySQL server capable of accepting writes is a single point of failure. Redundancy and failover mechanisms should be in place to ensure data availability and reliability.
