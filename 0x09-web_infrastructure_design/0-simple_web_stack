A server is a computer system designed to serve requests from other computers (clients). In this context, it hosts the entire web infrastructure and responds to user requests.

Role of the Domain Name: The domain name (foobar.com) is a human-readable name that points to your server's IP address. It makes it easier for users to access your website using a memorable name instead of an IP address.

Type of DNS Record "www" in www.foobar.com: "www" is typically configured as a CNAME (Canonical Name) record. It's an alias for the root domain and points to the server's IP address.

Role of the Web Server (Nginx): Nginx acts as a web server, handling HTTP requests from users' browsers. It can serve static files directly and forward dynamic requests to the application server.

Role of the Application Server: The application server runs the server-side code for your website. It processes dynamic content requests, such as generating web pages based on user interactions or database queries.

Role of the Database: The database (MySQL) stores and manages the website's data, like user information, content, and configurations. It's essential for data retrieval and storage.

Communication with the User's Computer: The server communicates with the user's computer through the HTTP protocol. When a user enters www.foobar.com in their browser, the browser sends an HTTP request to your server, which responds with the requested web page.

Issues with the Infrastructure:
Single Point of Failure (SPOF): The entire infrastructure relies on a single server. If this server goes down or encounters issues, the entire website becomes inaccessible. To address this, you can consider redundancy or high-availability configurations.

Downtime During Maintenance: When you need to perform maintenance, such as deploying new code or updates, you'll likely need to restart the web server. This may result in downtime, affecting user accessibility.

Scalability Limitations: This infrastructure may struggle to handle a significant increase in incoming traffic. Scaling resources like web servers and databases can be challenging in this setup.

While this design is simple and cost-effective, it may not be suitable for high-traffic or mission-critical websites. Implementing redundancy, load balancing.
