                          	Postmortem: Web Stack Outage Incident
 
Issue Summary:
 
Duration: The outage occurred from 10:00 AM to 1:00 PM on March 10, 2024 (UTC).
Impact: The outage affected the main web application, resulting in complete unavailability for users. Approximately 80% of active users experienced service disruption during the outage.
Root Cause: The root cause of the outage was identified as a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings, causing traffic to be improperly distributed among backend servers.
Timeline:
 
Detection: The issue was first detected at 10:00 AM when monitoring systems flagged a significant drop in server response times.
Alert: Monitoring alerts triggered notifications to the DevOps team, who began investigating the issue.
Investigation: Initially, engineers focused on database performance and network connectivity, suspecting issues in those areas. However, after ruling out these possibilities, attention shifted to load balancer configuration.
Escalation: As the investigation progressed, the incident was escalated to senior DevOps engineers and the infrastructure team for further analysis.
Resolution: At 1:00 PM, the root cause was confirmed to be a misconfigured load balancer. Engineers quickly corrected the configuration settings, restoring normal traffic distribution and resolving the outage.
Root Cause and Resolution:
 
Root Cause: The misconfiguration in the load balancer settings caused an uneven distribution of traffic among backend servers. This led to overloading of some servers while others remained underutilized, resulting in degraded performance and ultimately, service outage.
Resolution: The issue was resolved by adjusting the load balancer configuration to evenly distribute traffic among all available backend servers. This restored proper functionality to the web application and eliminated the service outage.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:
 
Improvements/Fixes:
Strengthen load balancer configuration validation procedures to prevent misconfigurations.
Implement automated testing of load balancer settings during deployment processes.
Enhance monitoring systems to provide more granular insights into traffic distribution and server performance.
Tasks:
Conduct a thorough review of load balancer configurations to identify any additional misconfigurations.
Develop and implement automated configuration validation tests for load balancer settings.
Enhance monitoring dashboards to include real-time traffic distribution metrics.
Schedule regular training sessions for DevOps teams on load balancer best practices and troubleshooting techniques.
Document incident response procedures for load balancer-related issues to facilitate quicker resolution in future incidents.
Conclusion:
The outage on March 10, 2024, was caused by a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings, resulting in service disruption for a significant portion of our user base. Through swift detection and diligent investigation, the root cause was identified and promptly addressed, restoring normal service functionality. Moving forward, we are implementing corrective measures to prevent similar incidents and enhance the resilience of our web stack infrastructure.
